# Football Squares Game â€“ README

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a **web-based Football Squares game**, designed to be both fun and easy to use. Players can participate by picking squares on a virtual game board, with the winner determined by the score of a real football game. This initial version will be free to play and is architected using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for scalability and performance. 

The web application will support up to **50 concurrent users** and provides a smooth user experience thanks to modern front-end technologies and a robust backend infrastructure.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **React.js or Vue.js** (TBD)

### Backend & Infrastructure:
- **AWS S3**: For static web hosting.
- **AWS CloudFront**: For content delivery and global distribution.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: For storage of game data such as player information, game board selections, and game results.

## Key Features
- **User-friendly interface**: Responsive design allowing easy play across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-time updates**: Players will see game updates as they happen, powered by DynamoDB and WebSocket or polling technology.
- **Scalability**: The game is architected to handle up to 50 users seamlessly, but future scaling possibilities are baked into the design via AWS services.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following are set up:
- AWS account with S3, CloudFront, and DynamoDB services enabled.
- Node.js and npm (for package management) installed locally.
- An IDE such as Visual Studio Code or WebStorm.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/football-squares-game.git

### Deployment
This application is designed to be deployed using AWS infrastructure. Instructions for deploying to AWS services will be added once development is finalized.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Authentication**: Add user authentication using AWS Cognito or another identity provider.
2. **Scalability**: The current design supports up to 50 users. To scale beyond this, further optimizations and load testing will be necessary.
3. **Monetization**: Add potential monetization features, such as in-game purchases or premium tiers.
4. **Leaderboard**: A feature allowing players to track top performers and statistics over multiple games.
